  WHAT IS MBOX2EML
====================
Have you ever bricked your email server?
Have you ever got the backup of your emails in mbox format?
Need to import only some of them in your new server simply using your
GUI client (eg. Thunderbird?)
Now you can easily convert your mbox huge file into several eml files
with your emails, and then open and decide wether to import them or
not.

Maybe a sed rule can be used? Maybe an awk script? Maybe some other
sort of utility? Couldn't find answer, so done uglyly by myself. Uglyly
is uglier than ugly itself. :-) And also doesn't exists.

  BUILD
=========
  g++ mbox2eml.cpp
  KISS Simple Stupid one-file app, uses only C++ STL

  USAGE
=========
  ./mbox2eml < MBoxFile

  produces one file per every email contained in MBoxFile
  WARNING: further runs of this program will overwrite older files!
